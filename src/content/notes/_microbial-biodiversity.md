## Getting nutrients
All organisms are divided into *autotrophs* and *heterotrophs*, according to how they get energy and nutrients, the former are capable of getting them by themselves, while the latter depend on others.

Autotrophs have multiple ways of getting energy, the most common being *photosynthesis*, meaning getting it from sunlight, and *chemosynthesis*, meaning getting it from some chemical substance. Some autotrophs are capable of also getting energy/nutrients from other organisms as well, but by definition, they do not require it. Most plants are autotrophs (a notable exception being carnivorous plants).

Heterotrophs on the other hand need others to survive. This relationship is not to be confused with a symbiotic one, as it isn't necessarily consensual. The other organism might be eaten, or its decaying corpse feasted on. All organisms that are considered animals are heterotrophs.

## Environments
Bacteria generally are the most resistant living things to extreme conditions. These extreme conditions could for example be anoxic environments, like certain landfills and ponds, where the water is frequently still for extended periods, or environments with extreme temperatures, like hydrothermal vents (where *thermophiles* live) or glaciers. Another interesting environment is a highly saline one, like the dead sea, where *halophilic* bacteria roam.

Bacteria that live in extreme conditions are called *extremophiles*, many of whom are *archea*, a group of living things that don't exactly fall either in the domain of prokaryotes or eukaryotes.

## Interactions with others
Bacteria aren't inherently positive or negative, however many are in regards to humans and other organisms, obviously in certain conditions and quantities. We call the generally negative ones *pathogens*, and those that are so positive that would have trouble living without them *symbionts*. Seeing as the human body is a fairly comfortable environment for certain bacteria, we are practically full of them and depend on them, see [microbiomes](@/notes/_biodiversity.md#microbioma).

Bacteria themselves also pretty much always live in communities, matter of fact we have never really found bacteria that live truly alone, even though they are capable of doing so. Some single-specied communities live inside a single capsule and communicate with chemical signals. Communities with multiple species, however, tend to be more advantageous, because even if they are slower to reproduce, they are more resistant, and could do things like recycle each others' waste. Some species in these communities are naturally more essential than others.

## Bioremediation
An interesting case of how the study of bacteria could be applied to the real world would be *bioremediation*, which is frequently used to do things like clean up oil spills or general pollutants. There are three main methods for accomplishing some a task.

- Genetic tinkering, which is usually very effective but also risky, in fact generally the genetically modified bacteria aren't let loose in the wild but are contained inside restricted areas like filters.
- Bioaugmentation, which is essentially introducing already existing bacteria to a new area, but it's frequently also risky and ineffective, seeing as they mightn't be well adapted to their new environment, leading to large swaths of them dying out and only making the problem worse.
- Boosting existing bacteria. This is generally the best option to go with, as modifications to the local ecosystem are kept to a minimum and it is very cost-effective.
